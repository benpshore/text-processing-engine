# TPE web app

The combined reader now wires the [batch controls](docs/BATCH_CONTROLS.md),
[storage lifecycle](docs/STORAGE_LIFECYCLE.md), and text preview before upload.
See the [integration handoff](../docs/WEB_ALPHA_INTEGRATION_20261004.md) for
combined evidence, required database migration, and rollback constraints.
These repository changes are not a new Site deployment.

The next citation/menu increment is documented in the
[consumer-boundary handoff](../docs/WEB_CITATIONS_MENU_BOUNDARY_20261004.md).
Its reference browser accepts supplied typed results; it does not run a
native/GROBID service or turn source links into a bibliography. The
[citation contract](docs/CITATIONS.md) documents source binding, independent
availability states, unverified provenance and the CSV projection.

This directory is the complete portable application source for the private TPE ChatGPT Site. It belongs to **benpshore/pdftextract**. It is separate from the repository's native Rust engine and macOS app.

## Application ownership

| Source | Web-app responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app/page.tsx`, `app/workspace.tsx`, `app/globals.css` | Authenticated mobile-first composer, per-item import queue, reader, saved records and navigation recovery |
| `app/chatgpt-auth.ts`, `lib/server.ts` | Managed Site identity, per-owner authorization, D1/R2 access and streamed result responses |
| `app/api/capture`, `lib/source-fetch.ts`, `lib/clip.ts` | Public source capture, HTML article/structured-page cleanup, RSS/Atom, Unicode, URLs/DOIs, tables and images |
| `app/api/uploads`, `lib/uploads.ts`, `lib/upload-client.ts` | Chunked originals/results/assets, SHA-256, completion receipts, atomic result revision updates and content detection |
| `app/api/documents`, `lib/article-assets.ts`, `lib/asset-storage.ts` | Private saved documents, actual retained article images, originals and ranged media playback |
| `lib/imports.ts`, `lib/image-ocr.ts`, `lib/office.ts` | Streaming archives, local image OCR and browser Office extraction |
| `lib/text-import.ts` | Conservative text preview before original storage, preserving source content |
| `lib/import-queue.ts`, `components/import-controls.tsx`, `lib/document-lifecycle.ts` | Shared intake and attempt lifecycle, explicit local cache/removal and confirmed owner-only deletion |
| `lib/workspace-storage.ts` | Device-local draft/interrupted-queue recovery; durable originals/results remain in R2/D1 |
| `public/pdf-worker.js` | Published upstream PDF Oxide 0.3.77 WASM in a disposable browser worker; **not** the complete native TPE engine compiled to WASM |
| `app/mcp/route.ts`, `lib/mcp.ts` | Authenticated read-only, paginated/streamed MCP access |
| `db/`, `drizzle/` | Authoritative document schema and immutable deployment migrations |
| `scripts/`, `build/`, `vite.config.ts`, package/lock files | Reproducible dependency assets, tests and Workers-compatible production build |
| `docs/OFFICE.md` | Office format evidence and explicit limitations |

PDF engines do not parse HTML. PHP-served HTML uses the HTML path; raw PHP source is retained as text, never executed. General binary/media originals can be stored without falsely claiming text extraction. Audio/video transcription, a native processing service, complete scanned-PDF OCR, full iWork decoding, and live JavaScript page rendering remain separate unfinished work.

No app-imposed source-file, PDF page-count, or archive-total-size rejection is configured. Transport part sizes are not file caps. Actual browser memory, OPFS quota, storage/hosting limits, and worker budgets still exist. A 50 GB mixed batch has **not** been validated; interrupted upload parts are not yet durably resumable across browser/device loss.

## Reproduce checks

Use Node 22.13+ and the pinned pnpm release. From this directory:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
node scripts/copy-pdf-wasm.mjs
node scripts/copy-ocr-assets.mjs
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
node scripts/test-clip.mjs
node scripts/test-web-extraction-review.mjs
node scripts/test-import-flow.mjs
node scripts/test-import-queue.mjs
node scripts/test-import-controls.mjs
node scripts/test-workspace-storage.mjs
node scripts/test-text-import.mjs
node scripts/test-citations.mjs
node scripts/test-office.mjs
node scripts/test-node-imports.mjs
node ../scripts/test-web-workspace.cjs
node ../scripts/test-web-reader.cjs
node ../scripts/test-web-upload-menu.cjs
node ../scripts/test-web-workspace-lifecycle.cjs
node --experimental-strip-types ../scripts/test-site-mcp.mjs
node --experimental-strip-types ../scripts/test-site-uploads-workers.mjs
node --experimental-strip-types ../scripts/test-site-lifecycle-workers.mjs
pnpm run build
```

Before local type checking/building, create the local binding configuration as described in `../docs/WEB_ALPHA.md`. An external host must implement a verified identity boundary rather than trusting caller-supplied authentication headers. Do not disable authorization to make deployment work.

The focused tests use JSDOM, mocks, Node/WASM and real local Workers D1/R2 bindings as identified in each script. They are **not** proof of iPhone/iPad browser behavior or 50 GB capacity. `scripts/test-browser-imports.mjs` is a separate browser harness; its execution has not been verified in this workspace.

Reader/Upload repair tracking and verification are documented in
[`../docs/WEB_READER_UPLOAD_REPAIR.md`](../docs/WEB_READER_UPLOAD_REPAIR.md).
`../scripts/test-web-reader-browser.mjs` mounts the actual reader and styles in
a synthetic local Chromium fixture with mocked service responses and actual
browser IndexedDB recovery. It exercises mobile layout and user interactions
without accessing a deployed Site or user
documents. Use a provisioned Playwright module and Chromium as described in
that script; a local browser pass does not certify iOS or private Site behavior.

## Source completeness and deployment

`SOURCE_MANIFEST.json` records the portable source's exact hashes, sizes and modes. Root `scripts/site_source.py` exports, verifies, and stages an import into a **new** directory. It does not deploy or overwrite an existing Site checkout.

Managed deployment configuration, credentials, database files, uploaded user files, installed dependencies and generated WASM/OCR assets are intentionally absent from the portable manifest. Logical D1/R2 bindings and MCP capability are reconstructed by the Site owner; dependency assets are reconstructed from the pinned package lock and copy scripts. These exclusions are deployment/data boundaries, not missing application implementation.

The root `.github/workflows/web.yml` owns web-app checks. Root Rust workflows validate the native engine separately. See the handoff for the exact published source revision, GitHub revision and test status rather than inferring production readiness from an open PR.
